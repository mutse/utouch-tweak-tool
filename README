### Building and running on Ubuntu Desktop

Building and running the UT Tweak Tool is quite simple. You will require Ubuntu
15.04 and higher to run on the desktop.

### Building and running on Ubuntu for devices (a.k.a. Ubuntu Touch)

If you want to compile the app for your device from the desktop, you need the
latest version of Ubuntu SDK, available on Ubuntu 14.10 and higher.

### Dependencies

Install development files:
sudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev qtdeclarative5-gsettings1.0

If you want to create an arm click package from Ubuntu SDK (Qt Creator), you
need to install those packages in your Ubuntu SDK kit.

From Qt Creator, open Options -> Ubuntu -> Maintain, and then enter:
apt-get install libpam0g-dev:armhf qtdeclarative5-gsettings1.0:armhf
